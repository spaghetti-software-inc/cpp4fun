Below is an **end-to-end example** of **domain coloring** in C++ with **CUDA + OpenGL** to visualize a complex function—specifically \(f(z)=z\).  We’ll color each point in the complex plane based on the **argument (angle)** and **magnitude** of \(f(z)\).  Additionally, we’ll overlay faint grid lines (radial circles and angular lines) that mimic the style of the reference image.

> **Domain coloring concept**  
> - We treat each pixel \((x,y)\) in the output as a point \(z = x + i\,y\) in the domain.  
> - We compute \(w = f(z)\).  Here, \(f(z) = z\), so \(w=z\).  
> - We extract  
>   \[
>       \text{arg}(w) \quad\text{(angle in }[-\pi,\pi]\text{),}  
>       \quad \text{mag}(w) = |w|
>   \]  
> - We convert \(\text{arg}(w)\) to a **hue** and \(\text{mag}(w)\) to **brightness** (or some function).  
> - We also highlight “grid” lines where \(|w|\) is near an integer radius or where the angle is near multiples of \(\pi/6\).  


1. Creates an **OpenGL** window using **GLFW**.  
2. Allocates a **pixel buffer** (PBO) shared between **CUDA** and OpenGL.  
3. Runs a **CUDA kernel** that, for each pixel, computes the complex color, draws grid lines, and stores the result in the PBO.  
4. Displays the PBO as a fullscreen quad in OpenGL.  
5. Lets you **pan** (right-drag), **zoom** (scroll), and **rotate** (left-drag around the Z-axis, if you wish) through the complex plane.


### **How It Works**

1. **Window + OpenGL Setup**  
   We use **GLFW** to create a window and manage input. **GLEW** ensures we have modern OpenGL function pointers.

2. **Pixel Buffer Object (PBO)**  
   - We allocate a PBO large enough to store one RGBA byte per pixel (`width * height * 4`).  
   - We register the PBO with **CUDA** (`cudaGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer`).

3. **CUDA Kernel** (`domainColorKernel`)  
   - Each thread corresponds to a pixel.  
   - We map pixel \((px,py)\) to a point \((u,v)\) in **normalized clip space** \([-1..1]\).  
   - We then convert \((u,v)\) to the **complex plane** coordinates \((z_{\text{real}}, z_{\text{imag}})\), factoring in the current **scale**, **pan** (\(g_centerX, g_centerY\)), and an optional **rotation** \(g_angleZ\).  
   - Since \(f(z)=z\), we get \(w=z\). We compute  
     \[
         \text{mag} = |w|, \quad \text{arg} = \mathrm{atan2}(w_{\text{imag}}, w_{\text{real}})
     \]  
   - We map **arg** \(\rightarrow\) hue, and **mag** \(\rightarrow\) brightness (or “value”).  
   - We optionally overlay **grid lines** (circles + radial lines) by darkening the pixel if:
     - \(\bigl|\text{mag}-\mathrm{round}(\text{mag})\bigr|\) is small (near integer radii).  
     - \(\arg\) is near a multiple of \(\pi/6\).  
   - We store the final color in the PBO.

4. **Texture and Fullscreen Quad**  
   - After computing the PBO, we `glTexImage2D` it into an **OpenGL texture**.  
   - A simple **vertex/fragment shader** draws that texture onto a **fullscreen quad**, filling the window.

5. **Interactive Controls**  
   - **Left-drag** rotates the complex plane about the Z-axis (`g_angleZ`).  
   - **Right-drag** pans the plane (`g_centerX`, `g_centerY`).  
   - **Scroll** zooms (`g_scale`).  

### **Adapting to Other Complex Functions**

- Replace `f(z)=z` with something else, e.g.  
  \[
    f(z) = z^2 \quad\text{or}\quad f(z)=\sin(z), \dots
  \]  
  Then compute  
  \[
      w_{\text{real}}, w_{\text{imag}} = \text{(some function of }z_{\text{real}}, z_{\text{imag}})
  \]  
  in the kernel, and the rest of the coloring logic is the same.

### **Further Ideas**

1. **Add More Grid or “Conformal” Lines**  
   - Show lines of constant \(\operatorname{Re}(f(z))\) or \(\operatorname{Im}(f(z))\).  
   - Animate them over time or on user input.

2. **Higher Resolution / Dynamic Updates**  
   - Let the user drag and zoom for deeper exploration of the function’s features.  
   - Increase the PBO resolution for more detail.

3. **Shading Based on Jacobian**  
   - Highlight regions of large/small derivatives \(|f'(z)|\).  
   - Great for exploring zeros or poles of complex functions.

4. **Multipass Rendering**  
   - Combine domain coloring with 3D illusions or custom overlays.  

With this approach, you can **domain-color** any complex function in real time on the GPU, overlay helpful grids, and interactively explore the result—just as shown in the spiral color image for \(f(z)=z\). Enjoy exploring the complex plane!
